# SHL Assessment Recommendation System

A semantic recommendation engine that returns the most relevant SHL assessments based on natural language job queries.

---

## Project Overview

This system uses sentence-level embeddings and semantic search to match job descriptions to suitable SHL assessments. I initially implemented the solution using Google‚Äôs Gemini embedding model. However, the results did not meet the accuracy expectations, particularly in retrieving relevant assessments. To improve performance, I transitioned to a sentence-transformer-based approach (BAAI/bge-small-en), which delivered significantly better and more consistent results.‚Äù

### Key Features

- Scraped SHL catalog using custom Python notebook
- Explored two embedding models:
  - Google Gemini (`embedding-001`)
  - Sentence Transformers (`BAAI/bge-small-en`)
- Built vector search with FAISS (cosine similarity)
- Benchmarked with Recall@3 and MAP@3
- Deployed:
  - Gradio UI on Hugging Face
  - REST API on Render (FastAPI)
