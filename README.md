# SHL-Assessment-Recommendation-System

A semantic search‚Äìbased recommendation engine that returns the most relevant SHL assessments for a given natural language job query. Supports both a web-based demo and an API endpoint for integration.

---

## Overview

This project uses NLP models to understand job descriptions and recommend suitable SHL assessments by semantically matching queries to assessment metadata.

- Data scraped from SHL's public catalog
- Uses both Gemini and Sentence Transformers for embedding
- FAISS for fast vector search
- Gradio (UI) and FastAPI (backend) for deployment
- Evaluated using Recall@3 and MAP@3
